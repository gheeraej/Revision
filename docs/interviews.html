<p>Math:
1) Questions on linear regression</p>
<ul>
  <li>Formula</li>
  <li>What to do with outliers (outlier detection, l1 regression)</li>
  <li>Test on parameters</li>
  <li>What problem appears with test if number of parameters tends to infinity (if alpha=5%)
2) Explain Gradient Boosting, SVM</li>
</ul>

<p>Algo:
1) Remove kth element from end</p>

<p>Open Problem:
Design a solution to detect videos with content violation</p>

<p>Math:
1) Application of Baye’s rule
2) Classification dataset (3 lines) with questions on it
3) Probability question: paquet are sent to a server. Probability of being well sent is 0.6. What is the probability that over 10 paquets, one is not sent well.
  First not sent and other sent = 0.4 * 0.6^9; Second not sent and other sent: 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.6^8, …
  =&gt; 10 * (0.4 * 0.6^9) = (10, 1)(0.4 * 0.6^9) (10 chooses 1)
4) Statistic: Is a dice faire: Average of N dices is X (2 ?)
  =&gt; Distribution of sum of n dices and then average of n dices (distribution/mean/std)
  =&gt; Which test
  =&gt; What does the p-value represent
  =&gt; Conclusion: is the dice fair?
5) Formula of R^2: 1 - SS_Residual/SS_Total = SS_Explained/SS_Total as SS_Total = SS_Explained + SS_Residual
6) Classification dataset (3 lines) with questions on it (VIF)</p>

<p>Data Manipulation
Algo:
1) Two files: one with one word per line and one with on sentence per line. Count how many time each word of the first file appears in the second file. Read in Python + Counter or regex.
2)
3) Given a string of digit, you can use one swap of values to maximise the number.</p>

<p>Code 1: Find if a string of only parenthesis is correct (ie parenthesis are correctly balanced)<br />
Code 2: Mouse in a Maze with no vision of the environment. It should find the cheese somewhere in the maze.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are given 2 functions :
    <ul>
      <li>One function Move that take in parameter the direction (up, down, left, right) and return True if the move can be made and False otherwise (if there is a wall for example),</li>
      <li>One function HasCheese that return True if the current state has the cheese</li>
    </ul>
