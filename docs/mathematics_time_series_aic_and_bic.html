<h1 id="aic-and-bic">AIC and BIC</h1>
<p>AIC and BIC are two information criteria that measures the quality of a model as a tradeof between its goodness of fit and its simplicity.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="aic">AIC</h2>
<p>The AIC or Akaike information criterion is a quality measure of a model. It is based on the likelihood function and it deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the simplicity of the model.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a statistical model of some data. Let \(k\) be the number of estimated parameters in the model. Let \(\hat{L}\) be the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following:</p>

\[AIC = 2k - 2 \log(\hat{L})\]

<p>A lower AIC is better.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The BIC or Bayesian information criterion is a quality measure of a model. It is based on the likelihood function and it deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the simplicity of the model.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a statistical model of some data. Let \(k\) be the number of estimated parameters in the model and \(n\) the number of data points. Let \(\hat{L}\) be the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model. Then the BIC value of the model is the following:</p>

\[BIC = k \log(n) - 2 \log(\hat{L})\]

<p>A lower BIC is better.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="usage-for-time-series">Usage for time series</h2>
<p>AIC and BIC are generally used in time series as there are the best quality metric for models. Cross-validation is more complex in time series (due to time dependance) and time series models are more computationally intensive thant other types of models.</p>
