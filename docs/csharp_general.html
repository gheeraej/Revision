<h1 id="what-is-c">What is C#?</h1>
<p>C# is a type-safe, object-oriented language from the C family used to create .Net applications with a component-oriented approach. The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio.<br />
As of today, Visual Studio Code, the .Net framework and platform and C# are free, open-source, and cross-platform.</p>

<h1 id="key-features">Key features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Simple language: Lacks pointers or direct memory modification vs. C++ or C</li>
  <li>Type-safe: Ensures variable data types are correctly defined</li>
  <li>Object-oriented: Define and use classes/objects</li>
  <li>Component-oriented: Reuse existing components without coding from scratch</li>
  <li>Open-source: Can develop apps on multiple OS, inc. Mac and Linux</li>
  <li>Interoperability: Can develop with managed and unmanaged 3rd party code</li>
  <li>Structured-programming: Can break programs into functions</li>
  <li>Rich library: Built-in functions speed up development</li>
  <li>Fast: Compilation and execution are very quick</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h1 id="compiler">Compiler</h1>
<p>C# is compiled in Common Language Infrastructure via the .Net framework. Is is then executed by the Common Language Runtime (similar to the Java Virtual Machine or JVM for Java). This makes C# easily transferable from one plateform to another.</p>
