<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>
<p>A Total Return Swap is a financial derivative contract between 2 party where the 2 party agree to exchange, at periodic dates, 2 cash flows. The buyer of the TRS agrees to receive the total performance of an asset or a basket of asset in exchange of paying a reference rate. Note that if the performance of the underlying is negative, the buyer is obliged to pay the value.</p>

<p>Here is a visual representation of flow exchanged in a TRS:

</div>

<p>It is important to note that TRS are funding cost arbitrages products.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<h1 id="advantages">Advantages</h1>
<ul>
  <li>TRS allow an investor to enjoy all of the cash flow benefits of a security without actually owning the security,</li>
  <li>TRS are off balanced sheet asset (the asset owner retains ownership of the asset): an institutional investor who has surpassed its balance sheet capacity may still speculate (or hedge) through a TRS,</li>
  <li>TRS are leveraged derivatives: hedge fund can use TRS to take leveraged positions,</li>
  <li>Investors can create new assets with a specific maturity not currently available in the market,</li>
  <li>Investors can reduce administrative costs via an off balance sheet purchase,</li>
  <li>A long-term investor who feels that a reference asset in portfolio may widen in spread in the short term, but then will recover, may enter into a TRS which is shorter than the maturity of the asset.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="formula">Formula</h1>

\[\begin{cases}
    \text{Leg}_{\text{Total Return}} &amp;&amp; = N * \left(\sum_{i=1}^{T}\left[(B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}}) + C_{(t_{i-1}, t_i)}\right] * DF_{t_i}\right)\\
    \text{Leg}_{\text{Floating}} &amp;&amp; = N * \left(\sum_{i=1}^{T} B_{t_{i-1}} * \left(DF_{t_i}^{financing}\right)^{-1} * DF_{t_i}\right)
\end{cases}\]

<p>With:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(N\) being the notional of the TRS,</li>
  <li>\(B_{t_0}\) being the spot price of the underlying bond,</li>
  <li>\(B_{t_i}\) being the futur price of the underlying bond as seen at \(t_0\),</li>
  <li>\(C_{(t_{i-1}, t_i)}\) being the coupon received during the period between \(t_{i-1}\) and \(t_i\),</li>
  <li>\(DF_{t_i}\) being the risk free Discount Factor at time \(t_i\),</li>
  <li>\(DF_{(t_i)}^{financing}\) being the discount factor associated with the financing rate at time \(t_i\).</li>
</ul>

<p>The repo rate is the key driver of the financing rate: if the holder of the collateral bond receive income from lending the bond at the repo rate, TRS would expect the spread to be subtracted from the financing cost.</p>

<p>\(DF_{(t_i,t_j)}^{financing}\) (equivalent to \(DF_{(t_i,t_j)}^{repo}\)) is the discount factor associated with the combination of the risk free rate on the period and the repo spread on the period (with the repo spread almost always negative - ie positive quotation as the quotation for repo is inverted).</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="implied-repo">Implied repo</h2>
<p>Implied repo can be easily obtained if different market values are known:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The risk free rate curve and the associated discount factors,</li>
  <li>The spot and forward values of \(B\).</li>
</ul>
